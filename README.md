# How to play
The object of the game is to fill the grid with black. On the grid, there are tiles which you have to click to change its color. When you click in a tile, the adjacent tiles (up, down, right and left) also change their colors. If a tile is white, it turns black, and if it is black, then, it turns white.  
**Try to win in the fewest click and time as possible!**
